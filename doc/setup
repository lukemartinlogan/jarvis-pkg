jpkg install c@2.3 ^ b@2.1

a:
b:
    depends_on('a@2.3', when='@2.3')
    depends_on('a@2.4', when='@2.4')
c:
    depends_on('a@2.3')
d:
    depends_on('c')
    depends_on('b')

Step 1: Create a list of packages to install
    - Unspecified version
    - Potentially override variants
    - Potentially override build-time dependencies
Step 2: Determine all candidate packages to be installed and their order
    - Initially passed package install list
    - Create a semi-initialized environment with this package list
        - Env is a dict mapping a package name to a Package
        - Env.Load:
            intersect versions
            intersect variants
            intersect dependencies
    - Start at the root package
    - Filter out dependencies depending on the current environment
    - Check if there are currently any conflicts with the current environment
