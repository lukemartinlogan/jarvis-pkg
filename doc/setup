How to handle multiple installers for same package?
    - Same namespace, installer included in the name
        DaosSconsPackage
        DaosAptPackage
        DaosYumPackage
        etc...
        Removes multiple inheritence
    - Multiple inheratiance
        Daos(SconsPackage,AptPackage,YumPackage,etc.)
        Maybe different default variants for different package managers
        Variants simply may be unkown
        Can change default_variants to be per-installer
            I prefer this solution
